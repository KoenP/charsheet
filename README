This is a program to generate character sheets for Dungeons & Dragons, 5th edition, with advanced automation features.

Currently hosted at https://koen.vosjes.cloud

The core of the program is an inference engine written in Prolog (rooted at `server/server.pl`). The user can interact with the inference engine directly through a Prolog interpreter (such as SWI-Prolog), or through a web interface.

To run the inference engine, install SWI-Prolog (swi-prolog.org/)
