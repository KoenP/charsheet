** Kinds of weapon variants

*** Categorization based on name

- Fully unique name: devotee's censer
- <weapon> of ...: dagger of venom, ...
- ... <weapon>: vorpal sword, berserker's axe

*** Mechanically

- Picking from list of weapons as base weapon, with baked-in enchantment.
- Fixed base weapon.
- Nominally non-standard base weapon, that is (partially) a standard base weapon in reality: boomerang proficiency is granted by proficiency with javelins.
- (not sure if exists:) fully custom (no meaningful pre-existing base weapon)

** Challenges
*** Representing enchantment
Many magic weapons have baked-in echantment values.
For example, a berserker's axe has a fixed enchantment of +1.
How do we represent this baked-in enchantment?

| Notation                     | Notes                                                                          |
|------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 'hand axe' ^ berserker       | enchantment somehow derived from the berserker annotation (separate predicate) |
| 'hand axe' ^ berserker + 1   | enchantment applied to ~'hand axe' ^ berserker~                                |
| ('hand axe' + 1) ^ berserker | enchantment applied to the base weapon                                         |
| berserker_axe('hand axe')    |                                                                                |



** Prolog notation
*** Weapon
**** Base weapon

longsword
'hand axe'

***** with enchantment
longsword + 1
'hand axe' + 2

**** Magic variant
***** Variant operator
'long sword' ^ vorpal

***** Variant functor
vorpal('long sword')

*** Armor
**** Base armor
plate
leather

**** Magic variant
***** Variant operator
plate ^ 'enhanced defense'
plate ^ 'enhanced defense' + 2
(plate + 2) ^ 'enhanced defense'

***** Variant functor
'enhanced defense'(plate)
'enhanced defense'(plate) + 2
'enhanced defense'(plate + 2)

** Notes
What makes picking tricky is that in some cases, the magic weapon "feels" like a variant of an existing weapon.
For example, "enhance defense" plate armor.
But in other cases, it feels like an item that's parameterized on a base item.
For example, the berserker's axe.
